# Malware Detection using Machine Learning

This project involves the development of a machine learning-based model to detect and classify malware. The project uses several algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify malware based on a dataset of features extracted from various files. The project explores data preprocessing, feature importance, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using various metrics.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Handling missing values and categorical data encoding.
  - Outlier detection and removal using Z-scores.

- **Feature Importance Analysis:** 
  - Visualization of the top features contributing to the classification models using Decision Tree and Random Forest.

- **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:** 
  - Implementation of Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal model performance.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall, and Jaccard Score.
  - Confusion matrix visualization to assess classification performance.
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis for model interpretability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - scipy
  - shap
  - xgboost

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy shap xgboost
```

### Dataset

The project uses a dataset named `dataset_malwares.csv`. This dataset should be loaded into the project directory for the script to access and process it.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/malware-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd malware-detection
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python malware_detection.py
   ```

### Workflow

1. **Load and Explore the Dataset:**
   - The dataset is loaded, and an initial exploration is conducted to understand the number of unique values, shape, and basic statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and remove outliers based on Z-scores.

3. **Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Generate visualizations to understand the importance of different features using Decision Tree and Random Forest models.

4. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Train Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models with optimized hyperparameters obtained through GridSearchCV.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the models using various performance metrics and visualize the results through confusion matrices and SHAP analysis.

## Results

- **Accuracy Scores:**
  - Decision Tree: Achieved an accuracy score of X%
  - Random Forest: Achieved an accuracy score of Y%
  - XGBoost: Achieved an accuracy score of Z%

- **Top Features:**
  - Visualized and identified the top 10 most important features contributing to malware classification.

- **Model Interpretability:**
  - SHAP values were used to explain individual predictions made by the models.
